# burl - Ben's Upcoming Roguelike Library
## A Roguelike Engine/Library Thing

I pulled all the common roguelike stuff out of Delvetown so I could re-use it in my spaceship game. Hopefully it someday turns into something that can be used by people?? That would be nice. Depends on www.github.com/veandco/go-sdl2 for drawing and input handling, someday sound too I guess.

Thanks for looking!
