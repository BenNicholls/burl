# burl-E - Ben's Upcoming Roguelike Library-Engine
## A Roguelike Engine/Library Thing

I pulled all the common roguelike stuff out of Delvetown so I could re-use it in my spaceship game. Hopefully it someday turns into something that can be used by people?? That would be nice. Depends on www.github.com/veandco/go-sdl2 for drawing and input handling, someday sound too I guess.

test/uitest.go is a little example program where I test how ui things look, you can use that as a SUPER basic example of a skeleton program. Otherwise, looking at my game Spaceshippers could be instructive although things are changing all the time. All in all I don't recommend using this just yet unless you love api breaks.

Thanks for looking!
